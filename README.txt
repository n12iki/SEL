The execution file is in the Source directory named rulesRunner.ipynb. The scripts were developed in Python 3.8.13. Although it is likely that other Python 3 versions will work fine. Python 2 will likely cause very different results. It is important to note some of the datasets were reshuffled after the report was written. As a result, some results may no longer match what is seen in the report. More details about each code can be found in the report and the rulesRunner.ipynb notebook. The original data sets can be found in the dataset folder. The created csv files can be in the train and test directories within the Dataset directory, depening on which they are. The Dataset directory also has the script to split the orgiinal dataset into a test and train. In the source directory, the rest are of the scripts are located. As mentioned the rulesRunner.ipynb is the script that is able to execute all the other scripts. IT will also have an explanation of how to use all of the different scripts. The text files in the source directory are the rules that were created by the training scripts.

Takes a long time to run. Needs to be changed to test every present combination instead of every possible. This would be done by going through the unclaimed points instead of the all possible rule combinations.
